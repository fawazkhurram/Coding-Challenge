I used k means because I knew from machine learning that it is used to determine clusters. I used the elbow method that is commonly used in k means to determine the correct amount of clusters. First I standardized the data for better results, and then I went through different k's from 0 to 15 to see which one would be the best cluster. Looking at the plot in the notebook it is at 3 that the graph starts becoming more linear. It was either at 3 or 6 where I thought it would be the best k value. I put both of them in on the original data and after outputting the plot, when k value was 3 visually looked more correct in choosing the clusters than 6 did. I have the scatterplot with k value 3 at the end of the notebook.
